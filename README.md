**Bstow Bstow Front end Potential Hire Project 2.0**

Goals:
- [demonstrate proficiency in UI/UX/Sketch/Javascript/ReactJS/HTML/CSS]
- [build something that scales gracefully & is easily extensible]
- [Write good notes and clean styles]

Prompt:

As Bstow expands internationally, we have a growing problem that many charities do not have
well-designed fundraising tools. To combat this, we'd like to be able to provide various types of
donation forms, widgets, and modals. One of our upcoming projects will be to allow
organizations to build crowdfunding pages/campaigns on our platform. They will need to be able
to see data overviews, donor history, donor profile, donations feed, campaign stats and setup,
brand settings, and more.
We’d like you to design and build a mobile-responsive crowdfunding page using React to help
us solve this problem. Create a Github account if you do not have one already and put all of
your source code on github. Your project should clear instructions on how to set it up and run it.
There should be the ability for a user to create and edit details for a crowdfunding page and
there should be the ability for a donor to go to the crowdfunding page as created by the user.
Here are some examples of crowdfunding pages:
- **[GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/1st-year-teacher-classroom-expense)**
- **[Crowdrise](https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/pathfinders3)**

Use this as a general guide. Once you design this, build it in ReactJS.
Your front end code should be CLEAN and ORGANIZED. Bstow has thousands of
organizations receiving donations through our forms. Our backend engineers should have an
easy time plugging in the BE to your FE. You do not​ need to build the back end.
Front-end should be done with React. Use any extra libraries you think will help. Choose
whatever styles, colors, fonts you think best. Once you finish, write up some docs. Ensure that
your code is clean, follows standard JavaScript style (though you can use 120 characters per
line) and has comments where appropriate.
Please delete all commented out code and make your solution as legible as possible.
Finally, make sure that we are able to run your project with your instructions.
It will take you 6-8 hours to complete and we give you 48 hours to send it back to us.
